	<p><em>Passionate Coder,Web developer and former student of <strong>Mount Olivet Sr. Sec. School</strong>.</em></p>
	<p>I am a student at Indraprastha University.I love coding, eating, bunking classes with friends and playing video games.I have completed my 12th from CBSE boards(School name not worth mentioning).My favourite teacher was Mr.Mukesh Jha he has given me a good understanding of Mathematics required for day-to-day life activities ( Not at all related to examination point of view) . 
	Biggest achievement of my life till now is 99 marks in class 12th Boards Computer Science Exam which also helped me in fetching a job offer in the first year of my college life in a well renowned American Company.Although I have decided with the consent of my parents that I will first complete my graduation then look for job in the future.
